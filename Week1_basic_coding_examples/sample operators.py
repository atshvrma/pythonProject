        #  1. Arithmetic Operators (for numeric calculations):
        # Operator	Description	Example
        # +	Addition	3 + 5 → 8
        # -	Subtraction	10 - 4 → 6
        # *	Multiplication	2 * 3 → 6
        # /	Division	10 / 2 → 5.0
        # //	Floor Division	10 // 3 → 3
        # %	Modulus (remainder)	10 % 3 → 1
        # **	Exponentiation	2 ** 3 → 8

        #
        #  2. Comparison Operators (for checking values):
        # Operator	Description	Example
        # ==	Equal to	5 == 5 → True
        # !=	Not equal to	5 != 3 → True
        # >	Greater than	6 > 3 → True
        # <	Less than	2 < 5 → True
        # >=	Greater than or equal	5 >= 5 → True
        # <=	Less than or equal	4 <= 5 → True
        #
        #  3. Logical Operators (for combining conditions):
        # Operator	Description	Example
        # and	True if both are True	True and False → False
        # or	True if at least one is True	True or False → True
        # not	Reverses condition	not True → False
        #
        #  4. Assignment Operators (assign values):
        # Operator	Example	Same as
        # =	x = 5
        # +=	x += 2	x = x + 2
        # -=	x -= 3	x = x - 3
        # *=	x *= 2	x = x * 2
        # /=	x /= 2	x = x / 2
        # //=	x //= 2	x = x // 2
        # %=	x %= 3	x = x % 3
        # **=	x **= 2	x = x ** 2
        #

        #  5. Membership Operators (check presence in a sequence):
        # Operator	Description	Example
        # in	True if value in list	3 in [1,2,3] → True
        # not in	True if not in list	4 not in [1,2,3] → True
        #
        # 6. Identity Operators (compare memory locations):
        # Operator	Description	Example
        # is	True if same object	a is b
        # is not	True if not same object	a is not b
